Additionally, the use of indentation instead of potentially confusing curly braces streamlines code readability. As a result of its straightforward nature, Python is a popular choice for schools, universities, and colleges introducing coding to students.\n",
    "#Easy to code -   Python is a user-friendly programming language that’s highly versatile. Despite being a high-level language, it’s easy to learn and grasp quickly. With just a few hours or days of study, anyone can learn to code using Python. Although it may take longer to master advanced concepts, modules, and packages, grasping the foundational Python syntax is much simpler than with languages like C, C++, and Java. Continue reading to explore more of Python’s features.\n",
